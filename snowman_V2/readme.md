# Final Project


## 2nd Code Plan

This project is a small game where the user can use the arrow key on the key board to travel through the map to find different body parts of the snowman.

First, I will move the background using imgage center mode and change the position of the center point as the arrow key being pressed to create the effect as if the user is traveling through the map. Then I will place images of the different body parts of the snowman all over the map for user to find. I will use the distance calculation to constantly calculate the distance between user and all body parts. As user come to those body parts, meaning when the distance is smaller than 20, by using the if statement, I will make the image of that particular body parts on the map disappear, than make the same image show up in the bottom-right corner to create the body part being picked up effect. I will also use teh cound library to load a background music and various audio notification when parts bring picked up. There will also be a snowing effect using function and this.
