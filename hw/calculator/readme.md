## Temperature Calculator

This program is a calculator where the user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit (°F) and the calculator will convert it to Celsius (°C).

* inputs
* temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)
* output
* message telling user what is the temperature in Celsius (°C)

First, I need the user to tell me the temperature in Fahrenheit (°F). I'll use a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I'll need a button. When the user clicks the button, I'll activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I'll grab the number subtract it by 32 then divide the result by 1.8. This will give me a the conversion. Then I'll return a message telling them the result.


## Geometry Calculator

This program is a calculator where the user enters the width and height of a rectangle and the calculator returns its perimeter.

* inputs
* width and height of the rectangle
* output
* message telling user what is the perimeter

First, I need the user to tell me the width and height of a rectangle. I'll use a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I'll need a button. When the user clicks the button, I'll activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get both values of the form input. I'll grab both number, add them up and multiply the result by 2. This will give me a the conversionthe perimeter. Then I'll return a message telling them the result.
