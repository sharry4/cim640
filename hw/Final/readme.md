# Final Project Ideas

## 1. Snowman
I will create a snowman with buttons for interaction (changing background, starting snowflake, some sound effect).

## 2. Collecting gold coins
I will create a game with a little man collecting gold coins. Within the game, there will be sound effects, and maybe option to change the background, etc.
