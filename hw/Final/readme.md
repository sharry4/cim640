# Final Project Ideas

## 1. Snowman
I will create a snowman with buttons for interaction (changing background, starting snowflake, some sound effect).

## 2. Map game
A game that a character can move along the canvas map. As he moves past different points of the map, various events will happen accordingly.

## 3. Collecting gold coins
I will create a game with a little man collecting gold coins. Within the game, there will be sound effects, and maybe option to change the background, etc.
