# Final Project

## 1st Code Plan

This project is a small game where the user can travel through the map to find different body parts of the snowman.

First, I will move the background to create the effect as if the user is traveling through the map. Then I will place different body parts of the snowman all over the map for user to find. As user come to those body parts, they wil be picked up and show in the bottom-right corner.
