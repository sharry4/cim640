    <h1>Sharry's Imaginary Dog Cookie</h1>
    
    <p>Hey! I am Sharry's imaginary dog and my name is Cookie. I am a border collie. I am highly intelligent and extremely energetic. I love spending time with Sharry. Every morning Sharry and I will take a walk together. Then when she comes back from school, she will bring me delicious food. We will eat together and she will tell me what happened during the day. I am always a good listener and will give her a hug if she had a hard day. I love Sharry and hope we can be together forever.</p>
